# speedtest-mqtt

A service that wraps a python script for running Ookla Speedtest CLI and report results to MQTT with Home Assistant auto discovery.  

A Home Assistant device will be created with the following sensors:
* Ping (ms)  
* Jitter(ms)  
* Download (Mbps)  
* Upload (Mbps)  
* Packet Loss (%)  
* External IP  
* ISP  
* Speedtest Server  
* Speedtest Timestamp  

It will also create a camera entity for the speed test snapshot image
